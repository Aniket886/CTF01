# Mini CTF Challenge - Educational Cybersecurity Game

## Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed to teach basic cybersecurity concepts through hands-on practice. Players will hunt for 5 hidden flags across different challenge types.

## Challenge Types
1. **HTML Comments** - Hidden information in page source
2. **Robots.txt** - Web reconnaissance and directory discovery
3. **Base64 Encoding** - Understanding encoding vs encryption
4. **Caesar Cipher** - Classical cryptography
5. **Trivia** - Cybersecurity knowledge test

## How to Run

### Option 1: Python HTTP Server (Recommended)
```bash
cd mini-ctf
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit: http://localhost:8000

### Option 2: Node.js HTTP Server
```bash
cd mini-ctf
npx http-server -p 8000
```

### Option 3: Live Server (VS Code)
If you have VS Code with Live Server extension:
- Right-click on `index.html`
- Select "Open with Live Server"

## Files Structure
```
